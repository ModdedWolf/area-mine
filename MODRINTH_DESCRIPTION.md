### 🎮 Smart Gameplay Mechanics

**✋ Crouch to Activate**
- Area Mine **only activates while sneaking/crouching**
- Prevents accidental activations while mining normally
- Toggle in config: `requireCrouch`

**⚒️ Pickaxe-Effective Blocks Only**
- Only mines blocks that pickaxes are designed for
- ✅ Mines: Stone, ores, deepslate, netherrack, concrete, etc.
- ❌ Ignores: Dirt, sand, gravel, wood, leaves, etc.

**⚖️ Balanced Durability System**
- **Tier I** (Area Mine I): 10% durability per block
- **Tier II** (Area Mine II): 20% durability per block
- **Tier III** (Area Mine III): 30% durability per block
- Combine with **Unbreaking III** and **Durability Boost** for maximum efficiency!

**Example:** With Tier III + Unbreaking III + Durability Boost:
- Base cost: 30% per block
- After reductions: ~5% per block
- Mine **20 blocks per durability point!**
