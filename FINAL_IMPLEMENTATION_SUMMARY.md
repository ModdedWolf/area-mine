# Area Mine v3.0.0 - FINAL IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

## ✅ BUILD SUCCESSFUL!

**Output File**: `build/libs/area-mine-1.21.10-3.0.0.jar`

## 🎉 ALL FEATURES COMPLETE!

### Final Two Features Implemented

#### 1. ✅ Mending Synergy - FULLY FUNCTIONAL
**Location**: `ServerPlayerInteractionManagerMixin.java` lines 321-328

**How It Works**:
- Detects if tool has Mending enchantment
- Repairs 2 durability points per block mined
- Only works if tool is damaged
- Only applies in survival mode (not creative)
- Respects `mendingXpToTool` config option

**Example**:
- Mine 50 blocks with Mending pickaxe
- Repairs 100 durability (50 blocks × 2 durability each)
- Effectively makes the tool self-sustaining if mending > durability cost

**Config**:
```json
"mendingXpToTool": true
```

**Action Bar Display**:
Shows "§7| §dMending ✓" when active

#### 2. ✅ Efficiency Synergy - FULLY FUNCTIONAL  
**Location**: `ServerPlayerInteractionManagerMixin.java` lines 344-348

**How It Works**:
- Grants bonus Mining Tokens based on Efficiency level
- Formula: `tokens × (1 + (efficiency_level × 0.2))`
- Efficiency I: +20% tokens
- Efficiency II: +40% tokens
- Efficiency III: +60% tokens
- Efficiency IV: +80% tokens
- Efficiency V: +100% tokens (DOUBLE tokens!)

**Example**:
- Mine 100 blocks = 100 base tokens
- With Efficiency V: 100 × (1 + (5 × 0.2)) = 100 × 2.0 = **200 tokens**
- With Efficiency V + Efficiency Boost upgrade: 200 × 1.5 = **300 tokens**

**Config**:
```json
"efficiencySpeedBonus": 0.2  // 20% per level
```

**Action Bar Display**:
Shows "§7| §bEfficiency 5" with increased token count

## 🎮 Complete Enchantment Synergy System

| Enchantment | Effect | Status |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| **Efficiency** | +20% tokens per level | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **Unbreaking** | -15% durability per level | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **Mending** | +2 durability per block | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **Fortune** | Increases drops | ✅ Already Working |
| **Silk Touch** | Preserves blocks | ✅ Already Working |

### Synergy Combinations

**Best Token Farming Setup**:
- Efficiency V (+100% tokens)
- Efficiency Boost Upgrade (+50% tokens)
- Result: 2.5× token earnings!

**Best Durability Setup**:
- Unbreaking III (-45% durability)
- Mending I (+2 durability/block)
- Durability Boost Upgrade (-15% more)
- Result: Tool repairs itself faster than it breaks!

**Maximum Power Setup**:
- Efficiency V (double tokens)
- Unbreaking III (60% less durability)
- Mending I (repairs while mining)
- Fortune III (more drops)
- All upgrades unlocked
- Result: Near-infinite mining with massive rewards!

## 📊 Token Earning Examples

### Without Enchantments
- 100 blocks mined = 100 tokens

### With Efficiency V
- 100 blocks mined = 200 tokens

### With Efficiency V + Efficiency Boost Upgrade
- 100 blocks mined = 300 tokens

### With All Bonuses (Efficiency V + Both Upgrades)
- 100 blocks mined = 300 tokens (upgrade)
- Mining more blocks faster = more total tokens per session

## 🛠️ Durability Math

### Default Setup (No Enchantments)
- Durability cost: 0.5 per block
- 100 blocks = 50 durability lost

### With Unbreaking III
- Durability cost: 0.5 × (1 - 0.45) = 0.275 per block
- 100 blocks = 27.5 durability lost

### With Unbreaking III + Mending
- Durability cost: 27.5 lost
- Mending repair: 100 blocks × 2 = 200 gained
- Net result: +172.5 durability (tool GAINS durability!)

### With Unbreaking III + Mending + Durability Boost
- Further reduced costs
- Even more durability gain
- Tool becomes practically indestructible
